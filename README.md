# ðŸ“Œ DSA Preparation

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) preparation** for placements. I started my journey to strengthen my problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews. My goal is to build a solid foundation in **arrays, recursion, dynamic programming, and advanced data structures** by practicing regularly. This repository will serve as my progress tracker, where I'll document the problems I've solved and the concepts I've learned.

## ðŸ“‚ Topics To Be Covered
- [ ] Arrays
- [ ] Strings
- [ ] Recursion
- [ ] Sorting & Searching
- [ ] Basic Data Structures
